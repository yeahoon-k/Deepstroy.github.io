I am a Ph.D. student in Graduate School of Data Science at Seoul National University with my advisor [Prof. Sanghack Lee](https://www.sanghacklee.me/). <br>
<br>
I studied Computer Science & Engineering for my B.S. and M.S. degrees. My research field was Human Computer Interaction based on deep learning model. Nowadays, I have been focusing on studying Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning through a **Causal Lens**.   

## Research Interests <br>
Causal Inference, Causal Machine Learning, Causal Reinforcement Learning <br>

## Conferences <br>
