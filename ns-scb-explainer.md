# Non-Stationary Structural Causal Bandits

## Background
In a stationary environment, the agent can leverage the causal diagram to identify optimal intervention sets—excluding irrelevant variables—that maximize expected reward, and this choice remains valid over time (Lee & Bareinboim, 2018). This works when the environment is fixed for all time steps, as illustrated on the left side of fig. 1.

**When the world drifts.** Under non-stationarity, the same behavior becomes myopic. The reward mechanism and the information that matters can change over time, so _yesterday’s optimal arm can degrade today_.

**What the agent is up against.** The hidden data-generating mechanism evolves over time. We analyze it through a time-expanded causal model (i.e., temporal models) whose transition edges encode how information from earlier steps can affect later variables. This changing information flow produces reward disparities across time, which we view as a reward distribution shift given by the intervention history. The key question becomes: _which past variables actually transmit useful information to future rewards?_

**How the agent should act.** We reason on a time-expanded causal diagram to separate what changes (reward distribution and effective information flow) from what remains stable. On this basis, we introduce POMIS$^+$—a time-aware extension of POMIS—together with two graphical concepts IB$^+$ and QIB to design non-myopic intervention sequences. Concretely, the agent may intervene on variables that are _irrelevant to the current reward but crucial for a future reward_ via transition edges. This structure-aware strategy clarifies which intervention sets to choose at each time step under reward distribution shifts, effectively identifying the **intervention sequence**.

## Problem setting (NS-SCM-MAB)
Let the bandit environment be generated by a time-indexed SCM (i.e., temporal model) $ \mathcal{M}\_t=\langle \mathbf{U}\_t,\mathbf{V}\_t,\mathcal{F}\_t, P(\mathbf{U}\_t)\rangle,\ t=1,2,\dots $with reward variable $Y\_t\in \mathbf{V}\_t$. An arm corresponds to an intervention $ \operatorname{do}(\mathbf{X}\_t{=}\mathbf{x}\_t) $ on a manipulative set $ \mathbf{X}\_t \subseteq \mathbf{V}\_t $. Transition edges between time slices encode how variables at time $t$ transmit information to variables at $t{+}1$ (right panel in fig. 1).

A reward distribution shift occurs when the conditional reward distribution changes across time given the intervention history $I_{1:t-1}$:
\\[
P(Y\_t \mid \operatorname{do}(\mathbf{X}\_t{=}\mathbf{x}\_t), I\_{1:t-1}) \neq P(Y\_{t'} \mid \operatorname{do}(\mathbf{X}\_{t'}{=}\mathbf{x}\_{t'}), I\_{1:t'-1})
\\]
Stationary SCM-MAB solutions are **myopic** here because they optimize $Y\_t$ in isolation and ignore cross-time information propagation.

### Example
Under the time-slice graph $\mathcal{G}[V\_1]$, the agent first computes the **MUCT** around the current reward $Y\_1$ (i.e., $\{X\_1, Z\_1, Y\_1\}$)    
Given this MUCT, the **in-slice interventional border (IB)** for $Y\_1$ is **empty**. Formally:
\\[
\operatorname{MUCT}(\mathcal{G}[V\_1],\, Y\_1)=\lbrace X\_1,\, Z\_1,\, Y\_1 \rbrace,
\qquad
\operatorname{IB}(\mathcal{G}[V\_1],\, Y\_1)=\varnothing.
\\]

Similarly, another MUCT and IB :
\\[
\operatorname{MUCT}(\mathcal{G}[V\_1]\_{\overline{X}\_1},\, Y\_1)=\lbrace Y\_1 \rbrace,
\qquad
\operatorname{IB}(\mathcal{G}[V\_1]\_{\overline{X}\_1},\, Y\_1)=\lbrace Z\_1 \rbrace.
\\]

</p>

Putting these together, the admissible manipulative sets for $Y\_1$ at time $t{=}1$ are the **empty set** (no intervention needed at the current slice) and the **singleton $\{Z\_1\}$** that becomes active once $X\_1$ is predetermined. Therefore:
\\[
\mathrm{POMIS}\_1=\lbrace \varnothing, \lbrace Z\_1 \rbrace \rbrace
\\]

Next, suppose the agent computes **POMIS** at time $t{=}2$.  
Given the time slice $\mathcal{G}[V\_2]$, the agent obtains the same in-slice family as at $t{=}1$:
\\[
\mathrm{POMIS}\_2(Y\_2) = \lbrace \varnothing, \lbrace Z\_2 \rbrace \rbrace.
\\]
However, when the agent chooses the **empty set** at $t{=}2$, the **temporal model** it actually faces is
$ \mathcal{M}\_2 \mid X\_1{=}x\_1$.
The model **reflects** the influence of a past value at $t{=}1$. Under this conditioning, the **local** POMIS on $\mathcal{G}[V\_2]$ **does not guarantee optimality** for $Y\_2$: the reward at $t{=}2$ can still depend on the prior assignment at $t{=}1$.

</p>

If we widen the view to the rolled-out window $\mathcal{G}[V\_1 \cup V\_2]$, we see that **$X\_1$ is the actual POMIS handle for $Y\_2$**, **but it is not intervenable at $t{=}2$**. This illustrates why relying only on the in-slice $\mathcal{G}[V\_2]$ can be myopic under non-stationarity and motivates using the temporal (cross-time) characterization.

## POMIS+ (temporal extension of POMIS)
**Single slice (POMIS).**  
At time $t$, we work on the in-slice graph $\mathcal{G}[V\_t]$ for the current reward $Y\_t$. We compute the in-slice interventional border $\operatorname{IB}(\mathcal{G}[V\_t], Y\_t)$. The resulting **POMIS** at slice $t$ is the family of admissible manipulative sets for $Y\_t$ determined by these IB computations.

**Cross-time objects (IB$^+$ and QIB).**  
To plan non-myopically toward a future reward $Y\_{t'}$ ($t' > t$), we read the temporal models on the time-expanded diagram:
- **IB$^+$ at $t$ toward $t'$** selects the **time-$t$ variables that still have leverage on $Y\_{t'}$ through transition edges** in the rolled-out window. We denote this set by $\mathrm{IB}^{+}\_{t,t'}$.
- **QIB at $t$** keeps the **current-time handles that remain interventional borders for $Y\_t$** (under the qualification conditions in the paper). We denote this set by $\mathrm{QIB}\_t$.

**Composition (definition of POMIS$^+$).**  
For a given pair $(t,t')$, the **POMIS$^+$** is defined by the **union** of the two graphical objects:
$$
\mathrm{POMIS}^{+}\_{t,t'} \;=\; \mathrm{IB}^{+}\_{t,t'}\!\big(\mathcal{G}[\!\!\bigcup\_{i=t}^{t'} V\_i],\, Y\_{t'}\big)
\;\cup\;
\mathrm{QIB}\_t\!\big(\mathcal{G}[V\_t],\, Y\_t\big).
$$
Under the time-slice Markov assumption used in the paper, it suffices to take $t' \!=\! t{+}1$.

**How it’s used (sequence construction).**  
At each step $t$, we compute $\mathrm{POMIS}^{+}\_{t,t+1}$ and select an element $S\_t \in \mathrm{POMIS}^{+}\_{t,t+1}$.  
The overall **intervention sequence** is then $(S\_1, S\_2, \dots)$, where each $S\_t$ is **exactly** drawn from the union $\mathrm{IB}^{+}\_{t,t+1} \cup \mathrm{QIB}\_t$—not an arbitrary set and **not** based on “including variables irrelevant to $Y\_t$” unless they are admitted by the union above.  
This is precisely the mechanism we formalized to align current-time leverage with future-time leverage under non-stationarity.

## Why stationary solutions fail
In a **stationary SCM-MAB**, the optimal arm for $Y_t$ is chosen under a fixed reward mechanism. Under **reward distribution shift** or altered **information propagation**, a myopic choice may:
- under-exploit **transition edges** that create leverage on $Y_{t'}$,
- over-explore variables with **no lasting effect**,

## What we demonstrate
- A causal formalization of **NS-SCM-MAB** with precise **reward distribution shift** and **temporal model** semantics.  
- A **graphical characterization** for non-myopic intervention design using **IB+** and **QIB**.  
- A constructive method to build **POMIS+ intervention sequences** that exploit **information propagation**.  
- **Experiments** showing improved **cumulative regret** and higher **optimal-action probability** versus stationary or naive baselines under non-stationarity.
